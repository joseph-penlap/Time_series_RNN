Forecasting using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

#‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Dataset‚ö°Ô∏è
This dataset consists of wind üí® and solar ‚òÄÔ∏è energy production (in MW)‚ö°Ô∏è records on an hourly basis for the French grid since 2020. Its primary purpose is to enable the Commission de R√©gulation de l'√ânergie (CRE) to calculate the reference price used in the calculation of additional remuneration for the wind and solar sectors.

#Time Series Forecasting: 
We train machine learning models on the hourly production records to forecast future wind and solar energy production levels. These predictions are crucial for grid operators, energy traders, and policymakers to plan and optimize energy distribution and utilization efficiently.
